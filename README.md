Myathlon
========

Myathlon is an app (in progress) for tracking a triathlon training schedule. Rather than an interface where a user must input their workouts, Myathlon leverages Twilio to allow members to simply text their workout (or weight or goals) to a number and have that info persist to the DB. Myathlon also leverages the Nike+ API (and soon RunKeeper) to pull workout details from those apps. 

Upcoming plans:
* Front end built on Angular
* Weight and total distance graphs rendered in D3
* "Seinfeld productivity" calendar to display workout streak
* Themes in Bootstrap
